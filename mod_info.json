	"description": "Shackles Garrison is comprised of the remnants of the XXVII Battlegroup, disillusioned with human rule after being left adrift for an extended period of time after the Collapse, seeing themselves as abandoned by the rest of humanity. Their arrival in the Sector was originally marked by a willingness to collaborate, but the geopolitically volatile environment of the Sector caused them to be embroiled in significant conflict with both Tri-Tachyon Technology and the Hegemony. These conflicts resulted in the annihilation of the Garrison's capital planet and significant fleet losses, forcing the faction to retreat to a small star system outside of the Core Worlds.\n\nThe net effect of these conflicts was to transform the Shackles Garrison from a disillusioned, somewhat cynical, but fundamentally collaborative faction with a decently-sized military force into a civilization driven almost exclusively by revenge. Specifically, a cold, patient, seething determination to exact vengeance on those who ultimately killed billions of their people, after they had arrived in the Sector with cooperative intentions. For now, they were weak, beaten, unthreatening - but they would bide their time, marshal their forces, sharpen their blades - and then there would be hell to pay.\nBGMs From:\nLuxury Elite - daphne\nLuxury Elite - Mall Madness\nLuxury Elite - Wave\nSky Gamblers: Storm Raiders",
